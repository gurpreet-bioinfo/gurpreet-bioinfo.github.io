### Research Areas/Interests
* High-throughput data (next generation sequencing, microarray, proteomics) analysis.
* Phylogenetic analysis.
* Integrating omics data analysis with network biology.
* Tools/database/pipeline development.
  
### Professional Experience
* 2018-   : **Bioinformatics Research Scientist**, [QBiC, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.](https://uni-tuebingen.de/)
	* Bioinformatics and Project Management: Multiple high-throughput data analysis projects from different organisms including consultation, design of experiments, downstream and pathway analysis.
	* Tools used: R packages, Nextflow pipelines.
* 2016-2018: **Postdoctoral Fellow (Bioinformatics)**, [Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tuebingen, Germany.](https://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/)
	* Bioinformatics and Project Management: Development and Evolution of Colour Patterns in Zebrafish and Danio species. My research focus was next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. I have done analysis of RNA-Seq data from different tissues of zebrafish and its mutants, and identified potential candidate genes which may be responsible for the pigmentation/colour pattern. Further, I have also analysed exomes of various Danio species and compared pigmentation related genes with that of zebrafish.
	* Tools used: R packages, samtools, bcftools, Zebrafish-specific resources (ZFIN, Ensembl etc.).
* 2009: **Teaching (Bioinformatics)**, [Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India.](http://online.gndu.ac.in/)

### Education
